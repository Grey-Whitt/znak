![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg 'License Badge')

This is a simple front end intended to interact with an ai developed by John Simmons, which excepts a base64 image via HTTP request and returns which letter of the alphabet it thinks is being represented in American Sign Language. The user will take a picture of their sign using their webcam, then can choose to retake the picture or send it to the ai for translation. When the user completes a word, they can then translate that word from english to cyrillic using the Yandex translation api. this is a custom ai with the front end built using React and React Bootstrap. It is set up in a modular way to allow for multiple methods of deployment, and additional pages in the future.
